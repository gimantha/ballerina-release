### Install Ballerina

If you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.

### Migrate from Swan Lake Beta releases
>**Info:** If you have been using Swan Lake Beta releases, delete the `Dependencies.toml` files in your Ballerina packages when migrating to Balelrina 2201.2.0 (Swan Lake). 

A few backward-incompatible changes have been introduced during the Swan Lake Beta program, and thereby, some of your existing packages may not compile with Ballerina 2201.2.0 (Swan Lake). Therefore, you need to delete the `Dependencies.toml` file to force the dependency resolver to use the latest versions of your dependencies.

### Developer tools updates

#### New features

##### CLI

Introduced the `bal graph` CLI command, which resolves the dependencies of the current package and prints the dependency graph in the console. This produces the textual representation of the dependency graph using the DOT graph description language.

```ballerina
$ bal graph
digraph "org/package:0.1.0" {
        node [shape=record]
        "org/package" [label="<0.1.0> org/package:0.1.0"];
        "ballerina/io" [label="<1.2.2> ballerina/io:1.2.2"];

        // Edges
        "org/package":"0.1.0" -> "ballerina/io":"1.2.2";
}
```

### Ballerina packages updates

#### New features

Introduced an `include` field under the `[package]` table in `Ballerina.toml`. It accepts a string array of paths to any additional files and directories, which need to be packed in the BALA file. The path should be relative to the package root directory.

```ballerina
[package]
org = "samjs"
name = "winery"
version = "0.1.0"
include = [documents/‚Äù, "images/sample.png"]
```
