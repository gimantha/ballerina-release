## Overview of Ballerina Swan Lake Beta1

<em>This is the Beta1 release in a series of planned Alpha and Beta releases leading up to the Ballerina Swan Lake GA release.</em> 

It introduces the new language features planned for the Swan Lake GA release and includes improvements and bug fixes done to the compiler, runtime, standard library, and developer tooling after the Swan Lake Alpha5 release.

## Updating Ballerina

If you are already using Ballerina, you can use the [Update Tool](/learn/tooling-guide/cli-tools/update-tool/) to directly update to Ballerina Swan Lake Beta1 as follows. 

To do this, first, execute the command below to get the update tool updated to its latest version. 

> `bal update`

If you are using an **Update Tool version below 0.8.14**, execute the `ballerina update` command to update it. Next, execute the command below to update to Swan Lake Beta1.

> `bal dist pull beta1`

## Installing Ballerina

If you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.

## Language Updates

### Improvements

- Worker deadlock detection has been improved to include the `wait` action.
- The `self` variable of an isolated object no longer needs to be accessed within a `lock` statement unless it is used to access a field that is either not `final` or is of a type that is not a subtype of `readonly` or `isolated object {}`.
- The `lang.xml:strip()` function does not mutate an XML value. Therefore, using the `lang.xml:strip()` function on immutable XML values is allowed.

### Breaking Changes

- An included record parameter of a function can only be specified after any required and/or defaultable parameters of the function.
- Additive expressions and multiplicative expressions are no longer supported with numeric values when the static types of the operands belong to different numeric basic types.
- Configurable variables are implicitly `final` now. Moreover, the type of such a variable is now effectively the intersection of the specified type and `readonly`. Therefore, configurable variables no longer support the `final` and `isolated` qualifiers.
- Type narrowing will no longer take place for captured variables of an anonymous function since the narrowed type cannot be guaranteed during the execution of the function.
- Type narrowing will now be reset after a compound assignment.
- Worker message passing after waiting for the same worker has been disallowed.
- When a named worker is used in a `wait` action, it can no longer be used in a variable reference anywhere else.
- When the type-descriptor is ambiguous, it is parsed according to the following table in which the precedence is specified in decreasing order.

  For example, `A & B | C` is considered to be `(A & B) | C`.

  | Operator                  | Associativity |
  |---------------------------|---------------|
  | distinct T                |               |
  | T[ ]                      |               |
  | T1 & T2                   | left          |
  | T1 &#124; T2              | left          |
  | function (args) returns T | right         |

## Runtime Updates

### Improvements

#### Improved Configurable Variables to Support Enum Types

Configurable variables with enum types are supported to provide values through command-line arguments and a TOML file.

For example, see the configurable variable with the `enum` type.

```ballerina
public enum HttpVersion {
    HTTP_1_1,
    HTTP_2
}

configurable configLib:HttpVersion & readonly httpVersion = ?;
```

The value for `httpVersion` can be provided via the `Config.toml` file or as a command-line argument as below.

**TOML:**

```toml
[configUnionTypes]
httpVersion = "HTTP_1_1"
```

**Command-line Argument:**

```bash
-ChttpVersion=HTTP_1_1
```

#### Improved Configurable Variables to Support Map Types

The `configurable` feature is improved to support variables with the `map` types through the TOML syntax. 

For example, if the `map`-typed configurable variables are defined in the following way, 

``` ballerina
configurable map<string> admin = ?;

type HttpResponse record {|
    string method;
    string httpVersion = "HTTP_1_0";
    map<string> headers;
|};

configurable HttpResponse response = ?;
configurable map<string>[] users = ?;
```

the values can be provided in the `Config.toml` as follows.

**TOML:**

```toml
[admin]
username = "John Doe"
mail = "John@hotmail.com"
location = "LK"

[response]
method = "POST"
httpVersion = "HTTP_2_0"
headers.Status = "200 OK"
headers.Content-Type = "text/html"

[[users]]
username = "Jack"
location = "UK"

[[users]]
username = "Jane"
location = "US"
```

### Breaking Changes

- The `io.ballerina.runtime.api.types.Type#getName` and `io.ballerina.runtime.api.types.Type#getQualifiedName` methods now return an empty string if no name was associated with the type. The `io.ballerina.runtime.api.types.Type#toString` method can be used to get the string representation of a type if required.
- `Wait` actions that wait for expressions that are not named workers can return errors now. The eventual type of such wait future expressions is now `T|error`in which `T` is the type of the original return value.

### Ballerina Packages Updates

## Breaking Changes

Taint analyzer is disabled and the `--taint-check` option is removed. The annotations `@tainted` and `@untainted` were left intact as placeholders for backward compatibility. Any script that used to pass the `--taint-check` option to the `bal run` or `bal build` commands will fail.
